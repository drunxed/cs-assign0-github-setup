Hi drunxed! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.

Reflection
Setting up my GitHub account and enabling two-factor authentication was straight forward. Cloning the repository was confusing because on my Windows system, I had troubleshoot several command-line issues and find workarounds to get Git working properly with my environment. It took me a lot of trial and error to get past authentication and path-related problems. I want to better understand pull requests and how they're used to collaborative projects and how to manage code reviews and merge conflicts.
